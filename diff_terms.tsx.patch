         <p>
-          GreenHaus facilitates orders between you and licensed retail partners.
-          Inventory, pricing, pickup, and delivery policies are set by each

-          retailer, not GreenHaus.
+          We expect respectful, compliant behavior. No attempts to bypass age
+          gates, tamper with the product, or harass dispensary teams. We may
+          limit or end access if policies are violated.
